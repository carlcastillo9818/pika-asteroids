# pika-asteroids

This program utilizes loops, the turtle module in Python, functions, and classes to set up and run a game
that is similiar to asteroids except the asteroids are little pikachu sprites and there is a custom space
background while the game is running.  The player can navigate their ship (shaped like an arrow) around
the screen and the more pikachus they can hit, the more their score will increase!
